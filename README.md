### Brain Assistant

I used the OpenBCI Ganglion Board with 4 electrodes attached to an EEG headband to tell me the date and time based on my mental state. 

I classified my mental state based on neural oscillations, which are essentially diffeerent frequencies your brain emit. You can read more about it [here](https://medium.com/@suryasure734/checking-the-time-and-date-with-my-brain-956ee1e11d84).

To run the code, connect your board to your computer via bluetooth and specify which USB port the dongle is occupying. Once you do that you can run this and see the output in the terminal or hear it if you have speakers.
